20) Hmmm. I didn't see the array yet, only that there is an 'object'.
If I'm lucky that is an array.
I'll try to log each item to the console first.
Thus I have to call renderTracks from the document.ready function to see anything.
Doesn't work as expected.

I think I have to revisit step 12) and stay there until I have this track list.

Steps to understand what happens:
- Go back to jquery lesson on ajax()
- Take a close look at he answer from the request displayed in a browser
  and make the beginning of this file readable by indentation (see sampledata)
- this reveals the internal structure of the data returned

-> the track list is thus
   data.results.trackmatches.track

- make the outer function return the tracklist
-> learn about callback functions ?

AHA! Problem resolved in a simple straightforward way:
call renderTracks from WITHIN the $ajax.success function!

console.log(tracks[0].name) inside renderTracks gives the expected result

time elapsed 1 1/2 h (total: 3 1/2 h)

Now I can resume in step 20)

24) Is there a way to get the track number when using (track of tracks)?
    substituted with counter variable
25) ok
26) Aha! I should have read all the instructions first...
    I still prefer to have visual progress in each step
27) ok
    Had to render the table header again
28) Tests not yet passing
